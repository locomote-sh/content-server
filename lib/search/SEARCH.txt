Overview:
* Each account gets a dedicated search DB containing the indexable contents of every
  public branch of the account's repos.
* Each search DB is an sqlite instance using the FTS extension.
* The core table in each search DB has the following fields:
    - repo name
    - branch name
    - file ID
    - file path
    - title
    - content
    - category
    - commit
* An ancillary table lists the last indexed commit of each branch, with the following fields:
    - repo name
    - branch name
    - commit
    - date of last index
* Search requests are executed as full-text search queries on the search DB. Queries execute
  against whatever content is available at the time.
* Search results are cached using a fingerprint formed from the search term + the latest
  commit ID(s) of the source branches included in the query results, i.e.:
    + search term
    + search mode
    + list of branch commits
* The search DB is populated and updated separately from the query mechanism (i.e. search
  index updates are not pulled / lazily generated as a result of query requests). This means
  that there may be a delay between content being published and content becoming available
  in the search index.
* Search DB updates are scheduled after startup, and triggered after each repo push.
* Each search DB update works for each repo as follows:
    - get the latest commit of content currently in the search DB
    - list each commit made to the repo since the last in the search DB
    - for each commit:
        - open a transaction on the search DB
        - list the updates in the commit
        - extract the indexable content 
        - insert or update the file record in the search DB
        - commit the transaction once all updates from the commit are inserted
  > Transactions are used so that commits provide a degree of content atomicity; i.e. content
    from a commit is only indexed if *all* content from the commit is indexed.
        - Make this a configurable option? Updates won't be missed so long as the ancillary
          commit table isn't updated until all updates are inserted
* Only indexable repos are included in the search DB. An indexable repo is a repo with
  { "indexed": true } in its manifest.
